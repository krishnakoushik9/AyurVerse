# Ayur-Verse: Unleashing the Power of 3D Sacred Tree Exploration!

Welcome to **Ayur-Verse**, where we smash the limits of traditional web browsing and dive into the vibrant, immersive world of **3D sacred trees**! We've combined cutting-edge tech and ancient knowledge to deliver an experience unlike anything you've seen before. Get ready to **interact**, **explore**, and **learn** about the most revered trees with a smooth, jaw-dropping user experience. 

We didn’t just make this cool—we made it CRAZY COOL.

## Why Ayur-Verse Stands Out

- **Mind-Blowing Welcome Screen with a Slider**: It’s not just a welcome screen—it’s an **entrance into a new dimension**. Drag that slider to 100% and BOOM, you’re instantly transported into our 3D sacred tree universe.
- **Next-Level 3D Tree Models**: You think 3D is cool? Wait until you see **our sacred trees** in action, powered by **LUMA AI**—it’s the stuff of legends.
- **Info-Packed Popups**: Wanna know why the Curry Leaf Tree is the boss of the culinary world? **Click those buttons** and get your mind blown with facts you never knew you needed.
- **Team Showcase**: Curious about the brains behind this genius? Just hit the **Team** button on the welcome screen and see what makes us the BEST. 
- **Bonus Button**: We’ve even thrown in a button that’ll teleport you straight to the **Smart India Hackathon** page. Yep, we thought of everything.

## The Magic Ingredients

- **HTML/CSS**: Yeah, we’ve got the basics covered, but we’ve taken them to the NEXT LEVEL.
- **LUMA AI**: Don’t get us started. We used this beast to bring our sacred trees to life in stunning 3D.
- **JavaScript**: Smooth transitions, slick popups, and the magic behind the scenes.
- **Linux-Based OS**: Developed and battle-tested on Linux—because we don’t mess around with second-best.

2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser. 

3. Feast your eyes on the welcome screen and crank that slider up to 100%.
